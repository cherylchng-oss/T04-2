    <h1>Televisions</h1>
    <p>There are different types of TV screen, some of which consume more energy than others. LED is the main TV display technology in use today. These have a liquid crystal display (LCD) that uses light emitting diodes (LED) for providing the screen with backlighting. Organic light emitting diode (OLED) screen TVs have become available recently to create light without backlighting. This is the same type of screen that some smart phones have.</p>
    <p>Higher resolutions (that is, 4K UHD, full HD, and 8k), larger screen sizes, internet connectivity, and screensavers that keep TV on for longer are leading to increases in energy consumption. LED and OLED energy consumption depends on screen brightness, so turning down brightness (the backlight setting for LEDs) can make the TV consume less energy (although this reduces the contrast ratio for OLEDs).</p>
